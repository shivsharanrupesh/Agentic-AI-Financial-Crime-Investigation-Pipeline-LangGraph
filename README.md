# 🕵️‍♂️ Agentic AI Financial Crime Investigation Pipeline

## Overview

A production-ready, modular agentic AI platform for automating Financial Crime and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) investigations.  
This system enables banks and financial institutions to detect, investigate, and manage suspicious transactions, significantly reducing manual workload and meeting strict compliance needs.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Agentic Architecture:** Each step (flagging, KYC fetch, ML scoring, LLM summarization, case management) is a self-contained, auditable agent.
- **KYC Integration:** Dynamically fetches customer KYC documents from Oracle DB.
- **ML Risk Scoring:** Assigns each flagged transaction a risk score using a pluggable ML model.
- **LLM-powered Summarization:** Uses OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo to generate high-quality, explainable case summaries for compliance analysts.
- **Auto Case Management:** Automatically opens, escalates, or closes investigation cases.
- **Monitoring:** Real-time Prometheus metrics for operational transparency and audit.
- **Production-Ready:** Secure, modular, fully documented, robust error handling, and environment variable-based config.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Ingest Transactions:** Loads transactions from a CSV file (or a database in production).
2. **Rule Agent:** Flags suspicious transactions based on configurable rules (amount thresholds, country, etc.).
3. **Data Fetcher Agent:** Retrieves customer KYC documents from Oracle DB.
4. **ML Scorer Agent:** Uses an ML model to risk-score each flagged transaction.
5. **LLM Summarizer Agent:** Calls OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo to produce a clear, human-readable summary for each case.
6. **Case Manager Agent:** Opens, escalates, or auto-closes cases based on score and system outcomes.
7. **Escalate Agent:** Handles all failures or exceptions, ensuring no cases are dropped and manual review is triggered as needed.
8. **Monitoring:** Prometheus-based real-time metrics for pipeline health, SLA tracking, and audit trails.

# What is the use of LLM in the Summarizer Agent?

## Business Context

In financial crime/AML pipelines, when a suspicious transaction is flagged, analysts need a case summary that pulls together the following:

- Transaction details  
- Reasons for suspicion  
- KYC info  
- Risk score  
- Recommended action  

Traditionally, these summaries are written manually—slow, costly, inconsistent, and prone to human error.

## How LLM Is Used in the Summarizer Agent

The **Summarizer Agent** leverages a **Large Language Model (LLM)** (like OpenAI GPT-4, Cohere Command, or Gemini) to automatically generate a human-readable, concise, and compliance-ready case summary.

### Input to the LLM:
- The transaction details (amount, country, customer, etc.)  
- Reasons why the rule engine/ML flagged it  
- KYC documents/info  
- ML risk score  

### Output from the LLM:
A well-written case summary that can be immediately reviewed by compliance teams or auditors.

## What Problem Does This Solve?

✅ **Saves Analyst Time**: No need for repetitive manual writing.  
✅ **Standardization**: Ensures all case summaries are consistently structured and complete.  
✅ **Audit-Ready**: Language models are instructed to include all regulatory-required facts in plain English, making every case fully auditable.  
✅ **Explainability**: LLM can be prompted to “explain the risk in plain language” so that even non-technical reviewers understand.


# Monitoring and Metrics in the Pipeline

## 1. What Does `monitor.py` Do?

`monitor.py` is the central place for all monitoring/metrics code for your pipeline.  
It performs the following functions:

- **Defines all metrics** (counters, histograms) using the Prometheus Python client.
- **Provides utility functions**:
  - `start_metrics_server()` → Starts the Prometheus metrics HTTP endpoint.
  - `setup_logging()` → Sets up uniform logging.

All other code (`main.py`, agents) imports metrics from `monitor.py` and increments/uses them.

---

## 2. How Are Metrics Used?

### A. **Global Metrics**
- `transactions_processed.inc()` → Increments each time a transaction is processed.
- `transactions_flagged.inc()` → Increments for each flagged transaction.
- `pipeline_latency.time()` → Measures total time for one transaction’s pipeline.

### B. **Agent-level Metrics**
For each agent, you:
1. Increment counters when an agent is called.
2. Measure how long each call takes.
3. Increment error counters on exceptions.
4. Increment action-specific counters (e.g., "how many cases auto-closed").

---

## 3. How Does Monitoring Work at Runtime?

### A. **At Startup**
- `main.py` calls `start_metrics_server(port=8000)` → Starts an HTTP endpoint at `http://localhost:8000/metrics`.
- Prometheus scrapes metrics from this endpoint on a schedule.

### B. **During Execution**
- Each pipeline run:
  - Global counters/histograms record pipeline-wide stats.
  - Each agent records its own actions (calls, errors, latency).
  - Metrics automatically accumulate in memory.

### C. **For Dashboarding and Alerting**
- **Prometheus** collects metrics (by scraping `/metrics`).
- **Grafana/OCI Monitoring** visualizes and alerts on them (e.g., "show latency per agent over time," "alert if error count > 10 in an hour").

## 4. What Questions Can You Answer With These Metrics?

| **Question** | **Metric to Check** |
|--------------|---------------------|
| “Which step is slowest in my pipeline?” | Agent-level latency histograms |
| “Are errors increasing in a particular agent?” | Error counters per agent |
| “How many cases are auto-closed vs. escalated?” | Case manager’s counters |
| “What’s my average end-to-end processing time?” | `pipeline_latency` histogram |
